# Building a Webpage for UFO Sightings

## 1) Overview

Update the UFO sightings page to provide a more in-depth analysis by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Specifically, add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## 2) Results

To analyze the data, start at the homepage below:

Next, you simply need to enter the relevant information in one or more of the filters to the left of the table. For example, if you wanted to see how many sightings there were in the state of Texas, simplt type "tx" in the state search bar and hit enter. The following will appear:

![Filter by State](images_readme/filter_state.png)

Another search might be to see how many sightings fit a certain shape. In the case below, we searched for how many sightings were designated as a "circle" shape:
